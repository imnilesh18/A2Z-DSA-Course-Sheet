There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table, the table may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date. 
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.

Write a solution to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.
Return the result table sorted by id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:
Input: 
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |

Solution:

/*
   Select distinct author IDs from the 'Views' table
   where the author has viewed at least one of their own articles.
   - Use DISTINCT to ensure each author ID appears only once,
     avoiding duplicates in the result.
   - The condition author_id = viewer_id checks for authors
     who have viewed their own articles.
   - Use AS id to alias the author_id column as 'id' for clarity
     and to match the required output format.
   The result is sorted by author ID in ascending order.

SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY author_id;
