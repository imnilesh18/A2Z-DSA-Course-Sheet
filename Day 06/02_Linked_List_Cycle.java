/*
 * 141. Linked List Cycle
 * 
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a
 * cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
 * be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos
 * is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected
 * to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
 * Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to
 * the 1st node (0-indexed).
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to
 * the 0th node.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * Input: head = [1], pos = -1
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

// Optimal Approach: Tortoise and Hare Algorithm
// Intuition: 
// In a linked list with a loop, consider two pointers: one that moves one node at a time (slow) and another that moves two nodes at a time (fast). If we start moving these pointers with their defined speed they will surely enter the loop and might be at some distance 'd' from each other within the loop.

// The key insight here is the relative speed between these pointers. The fast pointer, moving at double the speed of the slow one, closes the gap between them by one node in every iteration. This means that with each step, the distance decreases by one node.
